I am currently working as a `Machine Learning Specialist` at Elsevier in Amsterdam. I am part of the [Entellect](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/entellect){:target="_blank"} team where I build Machine Learning applications to problems in Life Sciences.

Previously, I obtained my masters degree Cum Laude in Theoretical Physics at the University of Amsterdam, including a Graduate Research Traineeship at McGill University. My graduate thesis explores one of the most fundamental objects in physics: spacetime. In string theory, the holographic principle supposes that the universe is built up like a hologram where spacetime can be reconstructed from the more fundamental quantum entanglement. This is known as emergent gravity, which is one of the striking results in the recent developments in Theoretical Physics.

Now my interests and research are around Machine Learning, NLP and Knowledge Graphs and their application to Science, for example in the domains Life Sciences or Physics.

I write about AI, Tech and Science in this [blog](posts).
